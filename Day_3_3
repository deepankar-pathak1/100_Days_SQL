Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), and the actual average salary.


Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  actual-miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.



SELECT CAST(CEILING(AVG(CAST(SALARY AS FLOAT)) - AVG(CAST(REPLACE(SALARY,0,'') AS FLOAT))) AS INT)
FROM EMPLOYEES;



select round(sum(LAT_N),2) as lat,round(sum(LONG_W),2) as lon
from 
station;




We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, 
and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. 
Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

: salary*month = earning 


select (salary*months) as earnings,
count(*)
from Employee  
group by 1
order by earnings DESC
limit 1;

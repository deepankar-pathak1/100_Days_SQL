where LAT_N between 38.7880 and 137.2345;

from 
STATION  
where LAT_N < 137.2345

The difference is simple.

The ROUND() is used to round a numeric field to the nearest number of decimals specified.

e.g. 56 is nearer to 60 than 50 hence it will return 60.
e.g. If instead of 56 you use 54 then 54 is nearer to 50 and it will return 50.

TRUNC() returns a number truncated to a certain number of decimal places. So it always takes the lesser value.
e.g. If you take the number less than 56 it is 60 so it returns 50.
e.g. Even if you use 54 it will return 50 only.

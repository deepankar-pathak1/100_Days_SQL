when we execute this stored procedure by return statemnet it will show error as conversion is failed when 
converting the nvarchar value 'sam' to datatype int.


--->
it will show this because whenver you execude stored procedure it return an integr variable
usually zero indicated success and non-zero indicate failure

-*- stored procedure always return integer value so keep in mind whene we deal with the return statement in 'SP' it will always return a integer value 

-->


select * from [dbo].[DimEmployee]

alter proc spgetNamebyID
@Id int,
@Name nvarchar(200) output
as 
begin 
select @Name = FirstName from [dbo].[DimEmployee] where EmployeeKey = @Id
end

declare @Name nvarchar(20)
execute spgetNamebyID 1, @Name out
Print 'Name = ' + @Name
